Cryptography is one of the most important and widely used techniques that are used to provide information security over the open and insecure networks such as Internet. Cryptography distorts the original message to ensure that encrypted data or resource is not made available to an undesired user for any purpose.

This paper aims to study the concept of cryptography and various techniques by which cryptography is practiced. The paper also attempts to give the idea of how modern-day cryptography has been carved out from older practices of encryption.
